           <h3>Sudden Confession</h3>
            <p>
                When you confessed your love to me, I was shocked and curious. I didn't really believe in first love.
                I couldn't really imagine a person loving me. I know it sounds dramatic, but It is from what I have observed.
                I always thought your feelings weren't serious at the time. I mean, we barely knew each other, yet you loved me?
                It sounds unrealistic. But I felt happy stil and I wanted to give the relationship a try, and even though we only 
                exchanged a night's messages, I felt a connection. After being lonely for years, I somehow enjoyed your company.

            <h3>Being With Her</h3>
            <p>
                Life has never been better. It was fun being with you. I have loved every second of it. I am normally the type to not 
                believe in miracles or superficials, but you made me believe in first love. It was insane how quick we got to connect and
                how we have so many similarities. It's as if you are a gift from God himself. Every moment with you was precious. You are an 
                addiction.
            </p>

            <h3>About Her</h3>
            <p>
                She is beatiful. That's for sure. A type that will make you smile if she smiles, also make you sad if she's upset. She affects everyone's mood. But for me, her beauty
                sets her apart from other women.<br>
                She is smart. She surprisingly has a better memory than me. It is kind of impressive to remember or recall different types of plants. She herself doesn't even 
                know how impressive she is

            After the tribulations that we had overcome, I have fallen for her deeply. We are 8 months in this confusing but relaxing relationship we have.
            After everything she has done for me, my love for her grew strong by the day. I love her too much. She brings a sense of comfort that will make you feel better.
            She is a dream come true.<br><br>
